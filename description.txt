I've tried to explain intuitively how a wing produces lift (in 60 seconds!), without having to resort to any famous names like Newton, Bernoulli, Navier–Stokes, Venturi (!) or Coandă (!).

Notes:

This video is, by necessity, a simplification (e.g. what happens at the convex leading and trailing edges), but does explain the bulk of the lift forces.

The relative curvatures of the streamlines above (a lot) and below (not much) the wing also give us a clue to their relative pressures, and therefore lift contributions.

It is also interesting to note how tiny the pressure differences actually are as a percentage of atmospheric pressure: around 6.5% of an atmosphere for a Boeing 737-900 (split unequally between the upper and lower wing surfaces); and for a performance glider/sailplane, it's only ~0.5% atm.

Many thanks to aeronautical engineer Steve Haselum for the explanation and finally clearing up this murky topic.
